Step to Set Up:
1. Make sure Node.js is installed on your device
    i. Go to your browser and search Node js and download the windows version
    ii. Install it (it would also install Chocolatey and some additional packages which would take a few minutes)

2. Go to VS Code
    i. Open Terminal
    ii. Change directory to backend using "cd backend"
    iii. type "node -v" to check if node is installed correctly
    iv. type "npm -v"
        a. If there is error you can try Ctrl + Shift + P and type "Terminal: Select Default Profile" and change it to Command Prompt
        b. By default it should be PowerShell of Windows, but since it might be restricted there just change it to Cmd and it works fine

3. After it is all set, we can try to establish connection to database.
    i. We need to install some packages that we need to run Node js on the server.
    ii. Change directory to backend (if not already in backend)
    iii. type "npm init -y" to make sure it is working
    iv. type "npm install express pg cors dotenv" to install the packages that we need
        a. express: Web server
        b. pg     : PostgreSQL driver
        c. cors   : Allow frontend/backend communication
        d. dotenv : Manage DataBase credentials securely

4. Create an index.js file in backend 
5. Create a index.html file in frontend to test the database connection
6. Create an environment file in backend (.env)
    i. This file should include the necessary credentials to establish connection to the database
